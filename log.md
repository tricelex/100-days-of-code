# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I installed python and pycharm. Learnt about its different data types


**Thoughts**: So Python doesnt end lines with semi-colon, first language I'm learning that doesnt't.
Then I read up on the PEP8 guide. I love that python has a well defined style guide, it'll definitely make things easier for me.
