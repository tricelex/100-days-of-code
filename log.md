# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I installed python and pycharm. Learnt about its different data types


**Thoughts**: So Python doesnt end lines with semi-colon, first language I'm learning that doesnt't.
Then I read up on the PEP8 guide. I love that python has a well defined style guide, it'll definitely make things easier for me.

### Day 2: May 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Lists and Dictionaries today, which apparently are the equivalent of arrays and objects in other languages.
Iterations and loops came easy, no much change from what im used to.


**Thoughts**: Yeah I already knew this but this is just another iteration...The most important thing just seems to be learning foundations,
most surtaxes and constructs are similar, regardless of Programming language. You can call this learning first principles



### Day 3: May 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today was all about classes and inheritance in python.


**Thoughts**: Python is definitely getting interesting.

### Day 4: May 13, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Went back a little to learn about string formatting and F strings, which are used for interpolating 
variables in python.
And also the format function, which can be used in changing  your variables output.
